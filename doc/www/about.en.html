<h2>onPHP</h2>
<p>
	onPHP - an extraordinarily rapid framework for the object-oriented programing
	on PHP 5. onPHP enables unique ability to provide and repeatedly
	surpass all speed of the sites developed on by the &laquo;pure&raquo; PHP, combining
	it with unsurpassed labour productivity of developer, here on orders
	decreasing the amount of errors and volume of debugging.
</p>

<h2>will benefit from onPHP</h2>
<ul>
	<li>sites with the enormous loading and permanent update of information;</li>
	<li>sites with the promoted requirements to reliability at the limited budget;</li>
	<li>
		unique sites &laquo;not written&raquo; into the
		prokrustovo's bed of standard CMS-engines;
	</li>
	<li>control by content systems which are easily created on the base of onPHP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>GPL</h2>
<p>
	onPHP spreads in source codes subject to the conditions of popular license &mdash; GPL,
	and it means that you will never run into dependence on a developer,
	and will be always able to make the alterations.<br>
	And if you have the own projects  - disemboguing in development of onPHP,
	you will save them for descendants, not giving to remain within
	the framework of proprietary project.
</p>

<h2>rapid development</h2>
<p>
	All of the tools, entering in onPHP, is created &laquo;from life&raquo;
	at development of some sites; many good patterns which most developers
	it is had to use on PHP are therefore realized, &laquo;reinventing a wheel&raquo;.<br>
	Library authors (also onPHP's developers) are also very like to release the time.
</p>

<h2>performance of the developed web sites</h2>
<p>
	Burdens costs on the use of onPHP are taken to the minimum,
	and the built-in effective mechanism of the scalable caching subsystem
	allows to be ahead of decisions on by the &laquo;pure&raquo; PHP
	on speed works of site, or it is considerably to reduce the vehicles
	requirements for the set speed.
</p>

<h2>intuitional rapid teaching</h2>
<p>
	It is possible to notice that on our site not too much document.
	onPHP is so organicly continues the best in the initial project of PHP,
	that allows to avoid &laquo;get bogged&raquo; in a project,
	and straight &laquo;lies down in a hand&raquo;.
</p>

<h2>faultless purposeful development</h2>
<p>
	Most errors appears at &laquo;transfusion from empty in empty&raquo; -
	input validation, transformation of data models for DB's relations,
	identification of users, differentiating of rights, etc.<br>
	Components and layers of abstraction of onPHP decide these tasks in
	a general view, allowing to be concentrated on creation.<br>
	XML prototyping allows to automatically generate the most
	&laquo;non-creative code&raquo; - (determinations of classes,
	DB schemas, DAO-classes, etc.). As a result reduction of volume
	of own code does a project &laquo;visible&raquo;.
</p>

<h2>lightness of support</h2>
<p>
	Web sites are created, as a rule, without a project document.
	When to you somebody's site developed by year-two back hand gets in a revision,
	it is often simpler to rewrite it anew, by what to try to understand.<br>
	With onPHP this far simpler - eventually, an existent site can be used as
	a demonstration prototype, quickly and unnoticed shifting to onPHP.
	And the participants of your command will take your code as a hint,
	seeing the best lines with PHP fresh eyes.
</p>

<h2>and finally, a fly in the ointment: onPHP disciplines a developer</h2>
<p>
	onPHP - object-oriented, and partly it's patterns are
	&laquo;spyed&raquo; from Java, Smalltalk, Zonnon, and not only.<br>
	Enabling creation considerably more difficult guided projects,
	by what usually accepted in PHP, onPHP by the spirit and structure induces a
	developer to &laquo;think, before to do&raquo;.
	And a developer is here forced gradually to promote the trade.
