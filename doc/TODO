# $Id$

* primitives refactoring:
form2object: maybe always use getValue, why lists are special?
define SimpleType and ComplexType interfaces (to use setter or dropper in b/o)
anonymous primitives (split fields and types)
make uniform lists: PrimitiveList()->of(AnonymousPrimitive)

* copy OpenId, Math, Crypto from 0.10 incubator (ael)
