# $Id$

* primitives refactoring:

form2object: maybe always use getValue, why lists are special?

define SimpleType and ComplexType interfaces (to use setter or dropper in b/o)

anonymous primitives (split fields and types).
Such primitives cannot be required or optional - it's field property
(case: we want to set field type but do not know, it is required or optional)

make uniform lists: PrimitiveList()->of(AnonymousPrimitive)

* copy OpenId, Math, Crypto from 0.10 incubator (ael)
